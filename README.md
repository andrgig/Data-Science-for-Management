# Data Science for Management

This repository is part of the Data Science for Management course I'm teaching at the University of Florence (Italy) during 2016/2017 academic year. This year you’ll learn (main module language in brakets):

- R and Python scripting (R & Python)
- How to explore business data (R & Python)
- How to build business dashboards using quantitative, qualitative and geo-referenced data (R)
- How to scrape web pages for business intelligence purposes (Python)
- How to measure customer engagement on Social Networks (Python)
- How to use data mining in your customer database (Python & R)
- How to segment and cluster customers (R)

Moreover, during the workshops you’ll make practice with other problems and interact with true industry professionals from international companies and understand how to solve real use cases... with business in mind :-)

Here I'm collecting notes on the preliminary [Python Course for Data Science](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/Python%20Course%20for%20Data%20Science.ipynb) and [R course for Data Science](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/R%20Course%20for%20Data%20Science.ipynb).

You can find also an [How to... ](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/MDS%20tools.pdf) document, which you may find useful for environments set up.

Applications to real business cases will be distributed during front-end classes and will cover additional libraries for data analysis and machine learning, frameworks for Big Data (Spark) and Cloud computing.
