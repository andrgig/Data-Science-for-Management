# Data Science for Management

This repository is part of the Data Science for Management course I'm teaching at the University of Florence (Italy) during 2016/2017 academic year.

Here I'm collecting notes on the preliminary [Python Course on Data Science](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/Python%20Course%20for%20Data%20Science.ipynb) and [R course for Data Science](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/R%20Course%20for%20Data%20Science.ipynb).

You can find also an [How to... ](https://github.com/andrgig/Data-Science-for-Management/blob/master/MDS%20tools.pdf) document, which you may find useful for environments set up.

Applications to real business cases will be distributed during front-end classes and will cover additional libraries for data analysis and machine learning, frameworks for Big Data (Spark) and Cloud computing.
